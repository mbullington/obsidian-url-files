# Obsidian URL Files

This is a simple plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md). Once I test it out a bit more and polish it, I hope to publish it on the Obsidian Community plugins.

Given an `nytimes.url` file (for example), with the plaintext content:

```
https://nytimes.com
```

This plugin will display `nytimes (url)` in the sidebar, and open it in your browser when clicked.
